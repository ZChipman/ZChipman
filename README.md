I'm a business-oriented Data Scientist passionate about using analytics and visualization to make an impact, both on and off the job. I hold a Master of Science in Applied Data Science with hands on experience employing programming languages/software, BI tools/dashboards, and machine learning algorithms to uncover insights in data sets of varying size and structure. I then use these insights to enhance decision-making and drive competitive growth. 

I possesses exceptional written and verbal communication skills, and I'm able to present complex analysis to both technical and non-technical audiences. I'm diligent problem solver with a love of facing new challenges, the ability to keep up with changing demands, and the determination to learn new skills that complement current knowledge. 

Feel free to message/connect through LinkedIn if you would like to discuss any and all things data science.
